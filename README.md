Physics-based modeling and system integration by a former project engineer.
# Ishzaka Science Lab

Welcome to the Ishzaka Science Lab repository.

This space is dedicated to activities centered on mathematical modeling and system design based on physics and economics.  
With practical experience as a project engineer and a strong interest in theoretical modeling and institutional design, I aim to contribute to DAOs and decentralized social systems from a scientific perspective.

## üîç Areas of Interest

- Physics-based modeling and simulation  
- Analysis and visualization of economic systems  
- Design of legal and governance structures

## üí° Contribution Style

I contribute through the following approaches:

- Creating research notes and technical documentation using LaTeX  
- Concept development and primary system design  
- Theoretical validation and mathematical model construction  
- And of course, full utilization of AI tools

## üéØ Objective

To support the construction of decentralized societies with scientific and institutional foundations, suitable for the Web3 era.  
This repository serves as a starting point for intellectual contribution and collaboration toward that goal.
